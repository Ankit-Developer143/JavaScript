/*  Understand the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared: */

(function() {
    console.log("A cozy nest is ready");
  })();

  //op:-A cozy nest is ready

  /* Condition:-The function should be anonymous.
  Your function should have parentheses at the end of the expression to call it immediately.() */
