/* In the following example,
 we first declare a function that returns a promise that resolves to a value of ðŸ¤¡ after 2 seconds. 
 We then declare an async function and await for the promise to resolve before logging the message to the console: 
 
await is a new operator used to wait for a promise to resolve or reject.  await send()
It can only be used inside an async function.
await USE ONLY INSIDE ASYNC FUNCTION
