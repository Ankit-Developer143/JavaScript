/* One possible solution is to set up a promise chain.
 To do this we’ll create a new function called addPromise. 
 Our function will take an input value, and will return a Promise.
 Here’s what the boilerplate code looks like: */


 /* function addPromise(x) {

    return new Promise(resolve =>{
        resolve("hello")

        //Code goes here
        //resolve
    })
     
 }
 addPromise("param")
 .then(x => console.log(x)) */


 /* Now that you’ve created an async function, 
 we can make use of the await keyword which will pause our code until the Promise has resolved. 
 Here’s how easy that is: */
