        <h1>Welcome To My Presentation</h1>

        <p>A presentation is the process of presenting a topic to an audience.
            It is typically a demonstration, introduction, lecture, or speech meant to inform,
            or to build good will or to present a new idea or product.
            The term can also be used for a formal or ritualized introduction or offering, as with the presentation
            of a debutante.
            Presentations in certain formats are also known as keynote address.</p>

        <p>A presentation program is often used to generate the presentation content, some of which also allow
            presentations to be developed collaboratively,
            e.g. using the Internet by geographically disparate collaborators. Presentation viewers can be used to
            combine content from different sources into one presentation.
            Some of the popular presentation products used across the globe are offered by Apple, Google and Microsoft.
